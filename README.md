# Shaders

Here you will find my various shaders.

Many of them are adaptions of existing shaders that I have modified for my own designs or in some cases they may only be adapations for use in EON Studio (although anything that can process these vertex and fragment shader files will also run them).

Eventually some of these will be adapted to be compatible with AFrame.
